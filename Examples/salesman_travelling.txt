this function solve the salesman travelling problem employing the functions cost and the function city_permutation
using a symmetric matrix of distance and the total of cities

for example:

distances = [
    [0,3,5,8],
    [3,0,2,7],
    [5,2,0,6],
    [8,7,6,0]]

minimal_cost, optimal_route = salesman_traveling(4,distances)
print(f"The minimal cost is {minimal_cost}.")
print(f"The optimal route is {optimal_route}.")

wich print

>>>The minimal cost is 19.
>>>The optimal route is (0, 1, 2, 3, 0).
