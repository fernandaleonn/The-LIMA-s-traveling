this function is a generator which helps us to create a matrix representing the distance between cities

example:

matrix_generator(6)

this print:
>>>[[0, 25, 29, 30, 30, 16],
   [25, 0, 5, 24, 34, 30],
   [29, 5, 0, 22, 18, 24],
   [30, 24, 22, 0, 9, 11],
   [30, 34, 18, 9, 0, 36],
   [16, 30, 24, 11, 36, 0]]
