# The-LIMA-s-traveling

Abstract: The traveling agent problem (TSP) stands out as a crucial challenge in the field of combinatorial optimization and persists as an open question in mathematical programming. This problem, with practical applications in areas such as logistics, route planning and resource distribution, has aroused deep interest in the scientific community since the 1950s. The inherent complexity of TSP manifests itself in the vast and exponential number of possible paths, making exhaustive exploration impractical. This project aims to address this complexity and explore a form of resolution, making use of two bounding functions, which will be explained during the course of the project; A historical introduction is presented, we will study the aforementioned concepts and also the Hamiltonian circuit, among other new concepts that will be clearly addressed.
Furthermore, we will see why this method is very useful and finally we will make a comparison between these functions.
