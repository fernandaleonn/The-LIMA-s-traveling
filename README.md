# The-LIMA-s-traveling

Summary:
The Traveling Agent Problem (TSP) stands out as a crucial challenge in the field of combinatorial optimization and persists as an open question in mathematical programming. This problem, with practical applications in areas such as logistics, route planning and resource distribution, has sparked deep interest in the scientific community since the 1950s.
The inherent complexity of the TSP is manifested in the vast, exponential number of possible routes, making exhaustive exploration impractical. This project aims to address this complexity and explore a way of resolution, making use...
